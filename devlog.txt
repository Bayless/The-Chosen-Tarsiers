Finished top-bar for general template and for users who aren't logged in
Finished front end for login/register page including forms with Foundation's Abide

Got Spotify authentication working -- in the search_field method
I must work on getting this saved the db, for the refresh purpose

Finally got new javascript-based map to load on page thanks with the help of Danny Qiu (stuy class of 2015) who pointed out something silly

connected login and register with the template

================2017-1-11================

roddaJ -- 2017-1-11 14:03
Got Spotify authentication working
It saves the access token in the database
Every time a spotify request is issued, it checks the access token
If no valid access token, it issues a specially formatted POST request to get the access_token
Search is now 100% working, complete with authentication
