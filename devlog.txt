I must work on getting this saved the db, for the refresh purpose

anyaL -- 2017-1-10 9:41:41

================2017-1-11================

roddaJ -- 2017-1-11 14:03

It saves the access token in the database
Every time a spotify request is issued, it checks the access token
If no valid access token, it issues a specially formatted POST request to get the access_token
Search is now 100% working, complete with authentication

anyaK -- 2017-1-14 19:50:08
When you click a country, the panel it's on get's updated with the country name!
I got AJAX to work!!!
Now, when you click a country on one map, the country is sent to my flask file which generates another random country (the actual implementation would get the country from the generated song), and sends it back to ajax, which calls javascript functions to move the other map to the random country and select it

anyaK -- 2017-1-14 21:42:35
