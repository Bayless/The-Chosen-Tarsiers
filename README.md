The Magic Music Matcher allows you to diversify your playlist. You may click on any country and will be given a popular song from that country. You can then click on the compare button and you will be given 5 more similar songs from a different country. Our unique algorithm for comparing the songs takes into consideration aspects of songs, such as timbre, tempo, and pitch to suggest musically similar, but geographically different songs for you to listen to. On top of having access to modern popular songs, you can search for your personal favorite tunes and look for similar songs using the same matching algorithms. Music is a major key to success, and The Music Thing will find you all the keys.
